HTML -->
	- HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE
	- It is a MARKUP LANGUAGE.
	- Markup languages uses TAGS to create a certain structure.

WHAT IS A TAG?
	- Tags act like containers in markup languages..
	- Tags allows users to apply specific structure to the content they are using.

How many types of tags are there?
	- There are 2 types of tags.

	1- Paired tag: aka (also known as) non-self closing tag
		sytax: <openingTag> content goes here </closingTag>

		ex: p, title, h1, em, ul, ol, div, table, a

			<p> paragraph content </p>
			<title> Google </title>

	2- Unpaired tag: aka (also known as) self-closing tag

		sytanx: <tag />

		ex: <hr> -> horizontal ruler
			<br>
			<img src="">

What is an attribute in HTML?
	- Attributes provide additional information about tags
	- If a tag is a paired tag, attributes ALWAYS GO into OPENING TAG.

	<a href= "https://google.com" class= "with blond hair"> GOOGLE </a>
	<a href= "https://google.com" class= "with black hair"> GOOGLE </a>

Attribute value: everything that is passed after = sign and into ""

What is the actual content of a web element?
	- The part that is in between the opening tag and the closing tag.

	EX#1 : <a href="https://google.com"> CLICK HERE TO GO TO GOOGLE </a>

	WHICH ONE IS THE TAG? --> a
	WHICH ONE IS ATTRIBUTE -->  href
	WHICH ONE IS ATTRIBUTE VALUE --> https://google.com
	WHICH ONE IS THE ACTUAL CONTENT --> CLICK HERE TO GO TO GOOGLE

If you are using chrome browser: (USUALLY!!!)
	- Purple : tag
	- Orange : attribute name
	- Blue   : attribute value
	- Black  : text displayed on the page (content)

How do you automate CAPTCHA?
	- You cannot automate captcha. That is the hole point of having captcha.
	- BUT you can get a BYPASS from the developers that will allow your automation code to just skip the CAPTCHA.

HOW DOES SELENIUM + DRIVER + BROWSER WORK TOGETHER?

- Browser does not understand Selenium+Java code.
- That's why we MUST have browser driver to be able to execute our selenium code in our browser.
- Think of the browser driver as the TRANSLATOR in between the browser and our SELENIUM+JAVA code.


MULTIPLE WAYS OF ADDING SELENIUM TO A PROJECT:
	1- Download and Add selenium jar files yourself manually.
		-> download and add webdrivers for each browser.

	2- Create maven project:
		-> Add selenium dependency into pom.xml file
		-> download and add webdrivers for each browser.

	3- Create maven project:
		-> Add selenium dependency into pom.xml file
		-> Add the WebDriverManager dependency

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT MAVEN:
	POM.XML ->
		POM -> PROJECT OBJECT MODEL
		XML -> EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE

	-> pom.xml file is one of the most important files in the project
	-> in this file we manage our dependencies.
	-> WHAT IS A DEPENDENCY?
		-> It is just a set of libraries that contains some ready classes and methods.
	-> We control the project dependencies from pom.xml file

STEP BY STEP CREATING A NEW PROJECT AND ADDING SELENIUM AND WEBDRIVER MANAGER:

	1- Click to "new project"

	2- Select Maven from left, and click next

	3- We need to add name of the project and, artifactId/groupId if needed
		groupID : is the company that owns the project (usually domain name)
			com.something
		artifactID : the project name. Whatever you pass into project name becomes the artifactId.
	4- click to finish to create the project

    5- in the pom.xml file create new tag called <dependencies></dependencies

    6- open browser and go to : https://mvnrepository.com/

    7 - search for ‘selenium java’ in the search bar

    8- Click to first result 'selenium-java'

    9 - select 3.141.59 version (or the latest non alpha or beta) version

	10 - ADD SELENIUM dependency into pom.xml file, inside of <dependencies> tag
		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
		    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
		    <version>3.141.59</version>
		</dependency>

	11- ADD BONIGARCIA(WEBDRIVERMANAGER)

			-> search for bonigarcia in mvnrepository and get dependency

			-> click to WebDriverManager

	12- Select latest non alpha/beta version
		which is right now: 4.1.0

		https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/4.1.0


TO ENABLE AUTO IMPORT ->

FOR MAC: GO TO PREFERENCES > Type "auto" in the search bar
			select both options

FOR WINDOWS: GO TO SETTINGS > Type "auto" in the search bar
			select both options


error: java: release version 5 not supported

Easy solution: copy paste this into pom xml above dependencies tag
	<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
	</properties>

This is not error. this is normal to have. -->
	SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".


//1- Setup the driver
        WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
        	--> We just call methods from WebDriverManager dependencies to set up our browser driver.
        	--> Another way of setting up the driver, if you are not using WebDriverManager:
        	 System.setProperty("driver.type","path to the driver");


//2- Create instance of the driver
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        #1- Creating the instance of the driver we are going to be using
        #2- This line opens you a blank browser.
        #3- Every browser that is opened is cache free browser. Browsing history is not saved.

//3- Use the driver instance to test selenium
        driver.get("https://www.google.com");

     .get METHOD :
     	-> ACCEPTS A STRING AS A PARAMETER
     	-> Gets the web page link that we give using selenium webdriver

driver.getTitle();
	- This method does not accept any parameters
	- Returns the title of the page as a String
	- RETURN TYPE: String

driver.getCurrentUrl();
	- This method returns the current URL value as a String
	- This method does not accept any arguments
	- RETURN TYPE: String


SHORTCUT: After creating a new variable, easy way to print out :
	String str1 = "something";

	str1.soutv + enter --> it will generate System.out.println("str1 = " + str1);

BASIC NAVIGATIONS USING SELENIUM:

	Basic navigations contains : back(), forward(), refresh(), and to() methods.

	These methods are doing simple actions as if the user has clicked the buttons on the browser.

	--> driver.navigate().back();
		-> This method will take the page the the previous page. You just go back.

	--> driver.navigate().forward();
		-> This method will take the page to the forward page.

	--> driver.navigate().refresh();
		-> This method just refresh the page.

	--> driver.navigate().to("URL");
		-> This method is similar to driver.get(); method.
		-> It does exactly the same thing the .get() method is doing.
		-> It goes to the given URL.
		-> The only difference in between .get() vs .navigate().to() is get method waits for page to load. But the .to() method does not wait for the page to load.


driver.getPageSource();
	--> returns the page source as a string

driver.manage().window().maximize();
	--> basically this line makes your browser maximized


driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
	--> works only in macs.
	--> same as clicking to the green button from the top left corner


driver.close();
	--> just closes the last opened window of the browser
	--> this only closes the last one

driver.quit();
	--> quit method closes all of the browsers opened in that session
